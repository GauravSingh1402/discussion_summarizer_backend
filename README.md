<p id="description">
SummaSense is a multimedia summarization tool that leverages AI to generate English language summaries for various types of input content. It is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend and Flask for the backend. With support for text, audio, and video inputs, SummaSense provides flexibility and accuracy in summarization.</p>

<h2 id="features">üí° Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

-   Step-by-step Process:
    
    -   The homepage guides users through the summarization process, providing clear instructions and a "Generate Summary" button.
-   Input Types:
    
    -   Text: Users can input text directly in the textbox or upload a document, which is processed with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify the input text.
    -   Audio: Users can record audio in real-time with transcription or upload an audio file for summarization.
    -   Video: Users can upload a video file, and SummaSense generates a summary based on its content.
-   Multilingual Support:
    
    -   SummaSense supports multilingual input and can process a variety of languages using the Google Translate API.
-   Content Editing:
    
    -   Users can edit the input content before proceeding with summarization, allowing them to refine and improve accuracy.
-   State-of-the-Art AI Models:
    
    -   SummaSense utilizes pretrained abstractive and extractive summarization models, such as Bart, LSA, and KL-Sum, to generate multiple summary options.
    -   Specialized model Conversation Bart is used to handle conversational input, detecting the type of input (descriptive or conversational) and selecting the appropriate model accordingly.
-   Succinct Title Generation:
    
    -   SummaSense generates a concise title for the content using the T5 model.
-   User Accounts and Profile:
    
    -   Users can create an account to save their summaries and titles in their profile for future use.


<h2 id="installation-steps">‚öôÔ∏è Installation</h2>
To run SummaSense locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the backend repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/GauravSingh1402/discussion_summarizer_backend.git
```
2. For setting the frontend of the project, follow the instructions in the [discussion_summarizer](https://www.github.com/GauravSingh1402/discussion_summarizer) repository
3. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd discussion_summarizer_backend
```
4. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
5. Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6.Export Flask environment variables:

* For Linux/Mac:
    
```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
```
  
* For Windows:
    
```
set FLASK_APP=app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development
```
    
7. Start the backend server:
```
flask run
```
